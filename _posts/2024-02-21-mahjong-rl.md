#### Hey there, Happy Chinese New Year! 🎉

So, I just got back from this awesome Chinese New Year bash, and let me tell you, it was a blast! Loads of laughter, heaps of food, and of course, catching up with a bunch of cousins I haven't seen in ages. But you know what's cool? A casual chat with one of my cousins sparked an idea that's now turning into a pretty wild project.

#### The Mahjong Moment 🀄

Picture this: we're knee-deep in a [mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong) game, having a blast, when out of the blue, my cousin drops, "Hey, why not make an AI that plays mahjong?" Lightbulb moment! So, from a simple family game, my new mission is to create a mahjong-playing AI. How cool is that?

#### Reinforcement Learning Vibes 🚀

Now, I'm no expert, but I've dabbled in reinforcement learning before – you know, solving games like bipedal walker and acrobot using the [gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) library. But mahjong is a whole different ball game. Gymnasium is more of a solo player's arena, and that's when I stumbled upon [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/). It's like gymnasium but for the multiplayer crew.

#### Enter PettingZoo 🕹️

So, PettingZoo is my new playground. My goal? Cook up a custom environment for mahjong and get my agent geared up for some serious training. [Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_reinforcement_learning) is the name of the game, and PettingZoo is my partner in crime. Exciting, right?

#### The End Game 🏆

Now, here's the kicker – I'm not just looking to make an AI that can play mahjong; I want it to beat the seasoned pros. Yep, you heard that right. My mahjong AI is going to be the new reigning champ, taking down the best in the game. Ambitious? Heck yeah. Achievable? Time will tell.

#### Stay Tuned! 🎮

This journey from a family celebration to a full-blown reinforcement learning project is gonna be a rollercoaster. Stick around, because we're diving into the world of PettingZoo, shaping a mahjong battlefield, and aiming for the stars with an AI that can outsmart even the most seasoned players. It's casual, it's fun, and it's about to get real interesting! 🚀✨
