### Job Scope

InsiderSecurity's [Automated User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)](https://insidersecurity.co/products/automated-user-and-entity-behaviour-analytics/) detects malicious user activity within both on-premise and cloud infrastructures. It leverages machine learning and advanced behavior analytics to identify threats like hijacked accounts, insider data theft, and compromised servers. Automated UEBA provides early detection, enabling timely action to prevent data loss. It is designed to be highly automated, reducing the need for large IT security teams, and is deployed by large enterprises and governments.

As a Software Engineer, I played a critical role in optimizing backend systems and enhancing the performance and scalability of Automated UEBA. My contributions spanned across automation, risk model improvements, and system integrations, ensuring high availability, security, and compliance with industry standards.

#### Risk Model Optimization and Scalability

Single-handedly led efforts to optimize the core risk scoring engine, improving its ability to process high volumes of alert data efficiently by implementing multiprocessing, streamlining code, and redesigning the caching mechanism. [This resulted in a 120%-160% performance improvement.](https://minsuan96.github.io/assets/pdf/BNWEngineV4_Results.pdf)

#### Automation of Sensor Role and Tag Assignment

Developed automated systems for the role and tag assignment of sensors, reducing manual intervention and improving the accuracy of sensor data processing.

#### System Integration and Compliance

Updated system components to comply with industry standards such as IETF RFC 5424 for logging, improving interoperability with external systems and ensuring adherence to best practices.

#### Tool Development for Data Management

Created tools for efficient data retrieval and visualization, including a GridFS snapshot downloader/viewer, improving data accessibility and system functionality.

#### Issue Resolution and Maintenance

Proactively addressed system issues, such as fixing SharePoint access problems, resolving sensor downtime handling, and ensuring smooth operation of saved reports and subsystem services.

### Technologies Used

- Python (multiprocessing, MongoDB)
- RabbitMQ for message queuing
- GridFS for data storage
- Compliance with IETF standards
- Automation and system integration tools

### Job Scope

Embarking on my role as a Global Software Service Engineer at Huawei's Global Service Resource Center (GSRC) in Malaysia has been an immersive journey, defined by continuous learning and impactful contributions.

#### Initial Learning and Certification

In my first week, I undertook a comprehensive series of learning modules and assessments, successfully earning certifications in key areas, including Information Security, Cyber Security, and Privacy Protection. These certifications, including the [Pre-Position Competence Certificate](https://minsuan96.github.io/assets/pdf/ppcc.pdf), [Cyber Security Certificate for Service Work](https://minsuan96.github.io/assets/pdf/cyber-security.pdf), and [Remote Delivery Certificate](https://minsuan96.github.io/assets/pdf/remote-delivery.pdf), laid a strong foundation for my subsequent endeavors.

#### Project Involvement - CelcomDigi Harmonization

As part of a transformative project, I am assigned to harmonize the operations of [Celcom](https://www.celcom.com.my/) and [Digi](https://www.digi.com.my/), two major network operators in Malaysia, who are undergoing a [merger](https://www.celcom.com.my/celcom-digi-merger). I am involved in gaining a deep understanding of Huawei's [Convergent Billing System (CBS)](https://carrier.huawei.com/en/products/service-and-software/software-business) because the project aims to update it to a new, unified system, consolidating functionalities from both companies. In the first month, I actively engaged in understanding the CBS architecture while concurrently contributing to the design of the harmonized business processes for [CelcomDigi](https://www.celcomdigi.com/).

#### Role Evolution - Testing CBS System

Transitioning to a more hands-on role, I am currently spearheading the testing phase of the harmonized and updated CBS. This involves a versatile approach, including:

1. HTTP Request Testing: Crafting and sending HTTP requests to various system interfaces, thoroughly verifying responses to ensure correctness.
2. Database Manipulation: Leveraging SQL skills for querying and updating the database, crucial for validating the system's functionality.
3. GUI Interface Testing: Directly engaging with the CBS GUI interface to assess and validate the overall performance and features of the system.
