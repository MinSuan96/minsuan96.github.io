## Job Scope

During my time as a student at the University of Edinburgh, I had an opportunity to contribute to become a teaching assistant as a Java Tutor and Marker for a [first-year informatics course](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cxinfr08029.htm). This role, which I undertook with enthusiasm and dedication, allowed me to develop not only a deep understanding of Java programming but also honed my communication and mentorship skills.

1. Tutorial Sessions:
    - Conducted weekly tutorial sessions for a group of 10 first-year informatics students.
    - Guided students through the intricacies of the Java course materials, ensuring clarity and comprehension.
    - Encouraged active participation and engagement during the sessions.
2. Marking Duties:
    - Assumed the responsibility of assessing and marking tutorial assignments.
    - Evaluated courseworks, which contributed to the final course mark of the students.
    - Delivered constructive and insightful feedback to aid students in their academic development.
3. Feedback and Improvement:
    - Emphasized the importance of pre-session preparation, requiring students to read and complete tutorials beforehand.
    - Facilitated discussions during sessions, providing a platform for students to ask questions and seek clarification.
    - Offered personalized feedback on both tutorial answers and coursework submissions, guiding students on areas of improvement.
