Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate individual with a love for gaming, problem-solving, and the ever-evolving world of machine learning. Let me share a bit more about the diverse facets of my interests and academic pursuits!

Academic Explorer ðŸ“š: I hold an MSc and BEng in Computer Science from [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), with a focus on machine learning. My machine learning ventures extend to diverse projects, including but not limited to what's shown [here](https://minsuan96.github.io/projects/). My MSc dissertation delved into the practical application of game theory in financial systems, aiming to optimize clearing payments through established algorithms. On the undergraduate front, I explored the theoretical realms of game theory, seeking equilibrium in a lattice with an underlying monotone function.

Gaming Enthusiast ðŸŽ®: Whether it's navigating virtual worlds or strategizing in board games, I find joy in the challenges and excitement that games offer. [Cryptid](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/246784/cryptid) has currently claimed the title of my favorite board game, providing a perfect blend of strategy and intrigue. When not deciphering game mechanics, I'm immersed in the expansive landscapes of [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/) and [Honor of Kings](https://www.honorofkings.com/), enjoying the unique experiences each game brings.

Lofi Hip-Hop Connoisseur ðŸŽ¶: Amidst the code and challenges, I find solace in the soothing beats of lofi hip-hop. [Slipfunc](https://soundcloud.com/pauli-niemi), [kudasaibeats](https://soundcloud.com/kudasaibeats), [In Love with a Ghost](https://soundcloud.com/in-love-with-a-ghost), [Monty Datta](https://soundcloud.com/montydatta), and [Shiloh Dynasty](https://soundcloud.com/shiloh-dynasty) are my go-to musical companions, creating the perfect ambiance for both work and relaxation.

Let's connect and delve deeper into the fascinating worlds of technology, gaming, and music! Feel free to find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minsuan-teh-8a0a31199/), or explore my coding escapades on [GitHub](https://github.com/MinSuan96). Excited to engage with fellow enthusiasts on this incredible journey! ðŸš€
