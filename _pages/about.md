Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate individual with a love for gaming, problem-solving, and the ever-evolving world of machine learning. Let me share a bit more about the diverse facets of my interests and academic pursuits!


Academic Explorer ðŸ“š: Armed with an MSc and BEng in Computer Science from the esteemed [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), my academic journey revolves around machine learning, with a particular fondness for reinforcement learning. Currently, my focus is on a cutting-edge project involving multi-agent reinforcement learning for Mahjong, with the ambitious goal of outsmarting the majority of players.


Projects and Dissertations ðŸš€: My machine learning ventures extend to diverse projects, from Twitter sentiment analysis to human activity recognition. My MSc dissertation delved into the practical application of game theory in financial systems, aiming to optimize clearing payments through established algorithms. On the undergraduate front, I explored the theoretical realms of game theory, seeking equilibrium in a lattice with an underlying monotone function.


Gaming Enthusiast ðŸŽ®: Whether it's navigating virtual worlds or strategizing in board games, I find joy in the challenges and excitement that games offer. [Cryptid](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/246784/cryptid) has currently claimed the title of my favorite board game, providing a perfect blend of strategy and intrigue. When not deciphering game mechanics, I'm immersed in the expansive landscapes of [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/) and [Honor of Kings](https://www.honorofkings.com/), enjoying the unique experiences each game brings.


Lofi Hip-Hop Connoisseur ðŸŽ¶: Amidst the code and challenges, I find solace in the soothing beats of lofi hip-hop. [Slipfunc](https://soundcloud.com/pauli-niemi), [kudasaibeats](https://soundcloud.com/kudasaibeats), [In Love with a Ghost](https://soundcloud.com/in-love-with-a-ghost), [Monty Datta](https://soundcloud.com/montydatta), and [Shiloh Dynasty](https://soundcloud.com/shiloh-dynasty) are my go-to musical companions, creating the perfect ambiance for both work and relaxation.


Let's connect and delve deeper into the fascinating worlds of technology, gaming, and machine learning! Feel free to find me on LinkedIn, or explore my coding escapades on GitHub. Excited to engage with fellow enthusiasts on this incredible journey! ðŸš€
